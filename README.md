# CiMo Notebooks

Notebooks around CiMo.

## Usage

This repository does not contain the original data files, but instead these are hosted on ``eecisc``. The notebooks use the library [eecisc](https://github.com/timtroendle/eecisc) to retrieve the data files. To run the notebooks you will need to have an account on ``eecisc``, remote access to the machine, and the Python library installed. Install it with:

    $ conda install -c timtroendle eecisc
